# Multi-Loader Project

This repository is built from a [multi-loader template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template) made by [Jaredlll08](https://github.com/jaredlll08).

This allows for developing a mod on multiple mod loaders at the same time and in a very convenient way without having too much duplicated code whilst also not requiring any additional dependencies or frameworks.

This project uses Quilt for the common project instead of VanillaGradle to be able to make use of [QuiltFlower](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower) (although this is actually also possible with Fabric Loom using [LoomQuiltflower](https://github.com/Juuxel/LoomQuiltflower) as I found out later).
